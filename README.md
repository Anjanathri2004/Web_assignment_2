This project creates a webpage titled "Zoo and Gadgets" that showcases a futuristic interaction between animals and electronic gadgets, driven by software and AI technology. 
The Zoo and Gadgets webpage leverages shadows, text styling, transformations, transitions, and animations to create an engaging and interactive user experience. The shadows applied to headings, cards, and containers give a three-dimensional depth to the elements, enhancing the visual appeal. Text is styled with uppercase transformations, color contrasts, and shadow effects, drawing attention to key sections. Transformations and transitions add smooth scaling, rotation, and movement when hovering over images and cards
In the Zoo and Gadgets webpage, animations are used to create lively, engaging interactions. The gadgets section uses a fadeInOut animation, making the gadget images smoothly appear and disappear at regular intervals. The button employs a bounce animation, giving it a playful, bouncing effect as it constantly shifts up and down, drawing the user's attention.
